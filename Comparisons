Comparison between Euclidean distance and Cosine similarity in Machine Learning

Cosine Similarity:

Advantages:
Scale-Invariant: Insensitive to the scale of features, making it robust when the magnitude of differences is not crucial.
Directional Emphasis: Emphasizes the orientation or direction of feature vectors, capturing similarity based on angles.

Definition:
Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors. In the context of image similarity, it assesses the similarity of direction between feature vectors.

Euclidean Distance:

Definition:
Euclidean distance, a classic metric, measures the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. In the context of image similarity, it computes the geometric distance between feature vectors representing images.

Advantages:
Sensitive to Scale: Takes into account the magnitude of feature differences, making it effective when scale is critical.
Intuitive Interpretation: Geometrically interpretable, providing an intuitive understanding of similarity in feature space.
