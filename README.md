Task Summary:
The code implements an image search engine using a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction. The main components include:

1.Vectorization: Images are transformed into feature vectors using the ResNet50 model.
2.Similarity Search: Given a query image, the system finds the most similar images from the database based on cosine similarity.
3.Visualization: The results are visualized, showing the top similar images along with their similarity scores.
4.Testing: The code includes a testing script using the unittest framework to ensure the correctness of key functionalities.
